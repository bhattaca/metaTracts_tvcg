\section{Changes and extensions}
The extended version as presented here, has the following major changes and extensions from the original paper of Bhattacharya et al.~\cite{Bhattacharya2015} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A sub-sampling algorithm.
	\item Addition of an interactive visualization tool.
\end{enumerate}

A sub-sampling algorithm has been added to the MetaTracts generation process. The sampling process provides considerable improvements to our space and time requirements. Sampling ensures that even minor features in fiber bundles in our datasets can be faithfully represented without increasing the number of MetaTracts generated.
Computing distances between MetaTracts is also and expensive process. We perform the sampling in a clever way and a bound on the distance by maintaining a closest set.

 
Second, we have added and interactive tool which helps us perform extensive  visual analysis on the fiber bundle based on interesting characteristics in a intuitive and simplified way.
