The questionnaire tests the effectiveness of MetaTracts in visualizing ``geometric structure" and ``spatial context". The Likert scale goes from 1-5: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree. }

We conducted a user evaluation to test the utility of our technique. Four NDT practitioner working with XCT, four material scientists experienced in analyzing CFRP's and four visualization practitioners participated in the user evaluation of MetaTracts. We set up a questionnaire, with questions on solving given tasks. The queries used Likert Scale (LS) for evaluating the performance of \mt over currently utilized techniques. 
LS consists of 5 levels which range from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". Figure~\ref{fig:userstudy} shows the results. The results are presented in the same sequential order that they appeared to the participant. The first set of tasks dealt with the effectiveness of \mt in comprehending ``geometric structure".

 
First we showed the participant a video of full 360{$^\circ$} rotation of the volume rendering of D1 along the Z-axis. We tasked the user to identify the number of separate fiber bundles. The results show that the participants found it difficult to determine the number of fiber bundles from the volume rendering itself. For the second task we mapped the ``top" eigenvector of the Hessian matrix to the RGB color map. We again showed a video of full 360{$^\circ$} rotation of the color-mapped and asked the same query. The Hessian based mapping a popularly used technique in fiber bundle visualization and provides more information about the major orientations than the  gray scale original volume. The results show that the evaluators performed better than the simple volume rendering test (task 1). Majority of our participants agreed or strongly agreed that the Hessian color map was more effective. Finally, we showed the video of the fiber bundles extracted with MetaTracts. 
All participants could correctly identify the number of fiber bundles and agreed that the \mt  is an effective tool for perceiving geometric structure  of fiber bundles, than simple volume rending or Hessian color map. They especially liked the 2D slices of the MetaTracts (Figure~\ref{fig:crop-16-decomp}b, compared to Figure~\ref{fig:data-char}c).

The second set of tasks dealt with the effectiveness of \mt in comprehending ``spatial context".
The participants where given a series of tasks to select fiber bundles which was largest, smallest or most similar to a given fiber bundle from a subset of fiber bundles. In the Likert scale, the majority of the participants agreed that the tasks where easier using \mt than the volume rendering of the original data or using the Hessian color map. 
The majority of the participants also agreed that the extracted meshes provided better spatial context than the volume rendering of the original data.
